      <h2>Hi, Iâ€™m Yuliia. Nice to meet you.</h2>
      <p>
        I began my IT career 3 years ago as a Manual QA Engineer. Driven by an
        insatiable desire to learn, I quickly developed an interest in
        automation. Now, I work as an Automation QA Engineer, utilizing
        frameworks Playwright and WebdriverIO to create end-to-end tests for web
        pages and mobile applications.
