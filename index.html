      <h2>
        Since beginning my journey as a QA engineer, I have gained extensive
        experience in remote work for various agencies, consulting for startups,
        and collaborating with talented teams to create innovative digital
        products for both business and consumer use. I am quietly confident,
        naturally curious, and continually striving to enhance my skills and
        knowledge. My commitment to quality and attention to detail ensures that
        the products I work on meet the highest standards of excellence.
